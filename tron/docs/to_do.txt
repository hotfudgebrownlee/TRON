TO DO:

2021.03.18
-Apply AI logic for random cycle movement
-handle trail collision and other cycle collision
-graphics and sounds

***************************ARCHIVED************************

2021.03.15
-How to do trail??
-Handle obstacle overlap
  -random x/y within certain quadrant
-Constant movement...
-Control AI and Player simultaneously
  -inherit control_actors class
  -have some variable to change input


2021.03.13 (* is not urgent)
main class:
*    trail creation (next week)
constants:
*    fancy images (next week)
handle collisions:
    obstacle collision
*    self collision (next week w trail)
control ai:
*    better AI (next week)

main class:
    trail creation
    obstacle overlap logic
*constants:
*    fancy images (next week)
input_service:
    if opposing directions, avoid collision logic
